# AllAvaliableServer

For running the server on eclipse, make sure the Tomcat 7.0 servlet is on and added into the build path. 
Start the Tomcat server first, then choose the AllAvaliable JSP file and click run button. As soon as the server start running,  a page saying "okok" will be rendered. All the message sent from the app will be shown in the console.
